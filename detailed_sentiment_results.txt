Text: i always buy flagships whether on emi or direct i was a iphone user samsung user and also a google nexus 6p user i have flashed roms and i know how today's os have bought the rights to famous stable custom roms from iphone 14 pro max to s24 ultra user i ahted the one ui 7 was the worst update i was hesitant to go for a chinese phone but after a lot of research i went for vivo x200 pro the flagship of vivio for india i wanted to buuly oppo find x8 ultra or vivo x200 ultra but it isn't available outside china i went for vivo flagship and my godd i went for the battery and performance was never a camera person but when i started meddling and experimenting with the zeiss vivo x200 pro camera my mind was blown this phone takes dslr level pictures has a great battery life and the ui is minimalistic and simple which at my age thats what i want small features like ir blaster caught my eye and the more i experimented with the camera the more i loved it even though married and with a son i was an introvert but after i got this phone i take whatever shot i want i suddenly turned artistic a man who never chose phones for cameras hated taking pictures or uploading on social media suddenly i turned into this photography bug my wife was scolding me when i got the phone coz i took her and my boy out i'd make reasons to take pictures and videos of anything beautiful or artistic i could find u just need to understand what aperture is rest u dont need pro mode the camera app will do what u want i'm extremely happy with my vivo x200 pro but its been only a month battery sot i'm getting 1 day 4 hrs with 15 battery left i always chose snapdragon processors but mediatek dimencity 9000 it just feels amazing but like other phones i'm not gonna update to new os update may it be android 16 or 17 trust me i've changed so many phones one thing i understood quite well use your phone as it comes out of the box they might promise updates but trust me if u remain to your stock os just leave it be it's some sort of greedy circle that apple and samms play make the os so hard in processing that you'd be forced to buy a new model

since i maintain my phones quite well my 24ultra even after 15 years got a value of ₹63000 so in exchange i got my vivo x200 pro for just 20k

Text: an all round phone should be something which includes each and every aspect of a device performance is important but it’s not that much important that other factors are neglected even a weaker processor can be used effective and efficiently if it is optimised appropriately current mentality in phone industry is to give user maximum performance even if the ui isn’t capable of doing anything extraordinary with the power

Text: sometimes i just feel stuck i'm doing my best to focus on my studies to build a better future — but not having a phone makes everything harder i do have a laptop and i’m genuinely grateful for it but i can’t carry it everywhere there are so many times i miss out on important classes study material or opportunities just because i don’t have a simple device to stay connected on the go
all i need is around 200 to buy a decent phone — not something fancy just something that works and helps me keep learning but even that feels like a distant dream right now my parents are doing all they can but we come from a humble background here in india and they just can’t afford it right now
i’m not asking for much — just a little support and if anyone out there helps me i swear i’ll never forget that kindness if i ever succeed in life — and i will i’m trying every day — i’ll repay that gesture ten times over because sometimes it just takes one person believing in you to change everything
thank you for reading this whether you can help or not your time means a lot

i'm using 13r
1) it has 8 gen 3 not 8s gen3
2) the glitch you showed in bgmi it's of refresh rate go to settings change it app specific settings to 120 for bgmi and it's work
3) for battery is better than 2 of them if we go on yt review for me in bgmi 3hrs 120fps it's down by 50  for booms day scrolling it's give eassily 9-10hrs battery back up
4)camera - it's not good as both but is 19/20 compared to gt 7  for photos in video 13r is losser
5) the one line you not say is in hand feel  i compared 13r and gt 7  trust me in front of 13r - gt 7 feels like cheap phone
6) after purchased value it's good in oneplus so it should be a point now a day

Text: i bought the 13r(12gb 256 variant) a month ago and i've been loving itthe performance is peak and the display is smoothyes the colours do look a bit washed out but it is not badthe camera needs adequate lighting to get good shotsfocus and lighting are the main issues of the cameraif u really push the phone it can heat up due to its metal body(playing unoptimized games does it) i played carx street and after an hour it was heating up pretty badly battery life is amazing and charging is quick for 39k i would say it's a good deal i wish it got dolby atmos support tho  the speakers are loud but could be great


btw the chipset is 8 gen3not 8s
hope this helps y'all

Text: all these offers might look exciting on surface but make sure 256gb will be enough storage for you today or even 3-4 years down the line the storage is not upgradable on these
i curse apple every single day for giving 256gb base storage on macbooks i mean its a computer not a phone or a tab my s24 ultra has 512gb i am using the og m1 macbook air 16gb ram and 256gb storage since 4 years great machine but i have to delete something every morning before i can start my day
i can't upgrade the storage i develop ios apps so i can't switch to a windows or linux device and i am too poor to upgrade to a mac that has 1tb storage

Text: any time i would say dont go for macbook air if you have even a moderate need of resources as it heats up af and you will need alot of cooling which still will make your macbook air throttle ( speaking from personal experience just using teams  powerpoint  7-10 browser tabs  and chat apps etc  it heats up quickly special if your laptop cam is on)… where as in case of mac mini getting a decent monitor will not cost you 15k but 7k only and a small bluetooth speaker will be less than 2k with that any bluetooth mouse and keyboard combo will be of 2k again rest the electricity bill wont be that high and mac mini has way better cooling than macbook air … in my opinion if you complete mac mini is being build in 60-70k you should go for that as you wont get that much thermal throttle on your mac mini which you get in macbook air else go for macbook pro

Text: the best laptop got even better

apple m4 already has the highest single core performance which decides the longevity of the product

add to that the high brightness display in that price segment the haptic touchpad  the speakers  the build second to none the new webcam all while keeping the price  consistent and even lower in this case despite tariffs while everyone else is increasing it

just because the cost of entry into apple products is high doesn't mean it's overpriced
it's an absolute bargain for what it offers in that price range

Text: apple m4 already has the highest single-core performance which decides the longevity of the product

add to that the high brightness display in that price segment the haptic touchpad  the speakers  the build second to none the new webcam all while keeping the price  consistent and even lower in this case despite tariffs while everyone else is increasing it

just buy a macbook air m4
they are efficient when doing extensive work too unlike these

the intel 238v is literally a most basic as_ soc you can get whereas with m4 you can get both performance and battery life even while unplugged 

but indian youtubers promoting overpriced gar_age as always for a few bucks and selling whatever integrity they had(in this case none)

m4 air can be bought for 90k and is so much better than this be it in every category
the only people hyping up this tr_sh are wannabe nerds who keep talking  about removable parts no matter how utterly pointless it is and overpriced

Text: it looks like the people here are missing the point about making tablets into a productivity machines people using a tablet as a media consumption device and not a productivity device is not indicative of preference i want to have a productivity tablet but i don't have one because they suck if they were better i would buy it having a small market share of productivity focused users of tablets does not mean people don't want it

apple has purposefully limited the functionality of ipad os because making it just as capable as macos would create competition within its own lineup (that is between ipads and macs) google doesn't have this problem and quite easily optimize android to function closer to a desktop without any compromises

also you mentioned at 852 - "the problem here isn't oxygen os its android" so why can't oxygenos and other step up and add features rather than blaming android the whole purpose of open-source android was this exact reason no like oneui they've added capabilities to stock android themselves right yeah i know you've mentioned 938 that oneplus or xiaomi can only make android 5/10 or 6/10 from 4/10 but cannot make it 8/10 but why can't they who is stopping them from improving aosp god zeus trump china

Text: everyone saying that people buy these tabs for content consuming etc and etc well talking about this tab its almost 50k and giving sd 8 elite which seems pretty value for money but whats the point of getting such powerful chipset and a big display when  can not even utilize it for people who are just buying a tab for so called content comsuming and study purposes then you can get xiaomi pad and samsung fe series but then whats the point of buying a high end tab just for watching content for now even apple is working on multitasking with ipad os26 but android is just stuck with some basic features as mentioned not for all the tabs but for high end tabs ig the video is right

Text: if you are comparing beta os's then you should have mentioned android 16 qpr 1 added fully functional desktop mode two weeks before ipados 26 beta google is also testing installations of full linux desktop apps in android just like chromeos also there is a full chrome browser with extension support also being tested for android tablets
you told ipados beta features but completely skipped what's coming in android maybe that would have made this video void 

also google can't force appdevs to bring their apps to android when asked most of ipad app devs will say ipad users pay more and there is no piracy problem

Text: the thing is most people use laptops for desktop apps like microsoft office suite ( no ms office on a mac or windows (desktop) is not the same as the phone  tab or even the ipad app) or adobe desktop apps so people don't need a tablet  they might "want" one though tell me one thing (for the masses) which can only be done on a tablet (leaving the niche things aside like digital art)

Text: as a student i need a tablet with big screen (nearly 13") to mainly watch educational content on youtube need a stylus for note taking and a polished os/software experience with useful features art or performance intensive tasks like gaming/editing/modelling are not my interests i am deeply confused between samsung galaxy tab s10fe+ oneplus pad 3 and lenovo idea tab pro (have already eliminated xiaomi pad 7 and ipad 11th gen due to 11 inch form factor) 
i know s10fe+ has best android os experience (especially samsung notes) with ai features but it is heavily overpriced (waiting for bbd) other android tablets provide superior hardware specifications in all areas let it be soc display speakers battery etc at half the price but they lack a refined os as that of samsung (one ui 7) or apple (ipad os) which tablet would be a better choice for me

Text: apple is unique in the sense that they design their own hardware software and services in-house
no other company does that

and just because the initial price of entry into their products is high doesn't mean they are overpriced
they are absolutely perfect for what they offer in their respective price range

the android guys are good till mid tier price range but when it comes to flagship prices those guys are absolute scamsters in that they want to charge higher than apple without even putting in half the effort to perfect their devices

these android oems would rather produce half assed overpriced garbage than undercutting apple by the right price point

all the t_rds in the comments simply can't accept apple makes better products when it comes to this price range 
apple has the best display when it comes to color accuracy and highest typicalauto brightness and hdr brightness over 70 area

better speakers and haptics and build quality
better soc by far
better pics except some gimmicky scenarios
far better videos and stability with support for prores
more stable and better ui/ux  and polished os

but alas indian turds love hating on apple blindly without understanding their business model
these android guys are the scamsters for trying to charge the same prices as apple without even putting in half the effort

Text: i don't know what to think about this video it is pretty confusinglet me explain 

1) a lot of the complaints he made about oneplus pad 3 in general are about using it for productivity with a keyboardas far as i know a lot of youtubers has complaints about such a usage regarding ipads as well there are innumerable videos of youtubers trying to replace their macs with ipads with modest success being the best possible outcome so did the ipad os26 finally solved this issueif no then why harp on about a problem that is common to all tablets whether by android or the fruit company just accept that tablets are not going to replace laptops whether you go apple way or android way and live with it 

2) then the complaints are about lack of app support in playstore compared to android quite a fair point especially if you need some specialized apps

3) why no mention of samsung tablets at all and their dex mode if usage like a laptop is a big miss in oneplus pad 3 samsung is a oneplus competitor and it is in android space as well a video titled like this needs to mention samsung tablets as well as they do something no other android tablets does

Text: saying android tablets suck just because there's no separate 'android tablet os' is a shallow take as someone who actually develops android apps let me clarify android already provides powerful tools for developers to create modular responsive uis that scale beautifully across screen sizes — including tablets foldables and desktops

the real issue isn’t android or google — it’s developer negligence many developers just don’t bother optimizing their apps for large screens even though android jetpack constraint layouts resource qualifiers and window size classes make it easier than ever

unlike ipados which is basically ios with a different name and a few tweaks android doesn’t need to spin off a separate os the framework is already built with flexibility in mind — you just have to use it

what’s frustrating is how some tech youtubers without any hands-on app development experience keep pushing these narratives based on surface-level impressions if you're not building apps maybe don't speak for the platform

Text: the shoelaces are definitely not a 9/10 i have a pair of shoes with the original ratchet mechanism granted it is expensive but it tightens all the way from the front i bought this to test them out 
2 problems 
1  the mechanism tends to move around a bit and flip when you loosen it 
2 it tightens only the part closest to the mechanism the rest of the lace remains loose
it's a 6 or 7 at the most

the major problems are no connection to pc without itunes no control over files network and it has same number of bugs as a flagship android
so switched back to s25  would suggest everyone to stay away it takes away all control you will always feel like "you are using iphone as apple wants you to use not how you want to"

Text: this comment is prolly gonna get lost in the comment section but trying to write something different here 1st off great video i learned something from it and i genuinely love when tech tubers do tech video essays like these this was super engaging  loved seeing your supportive inclusive channel task force as well  

i also think that more than any other strategy buy now pay laters and emis have played a very big role in making indians actually afford iphones—like the emi sector is definitely working overtime so people can buy iphones especially during sales its fascinating because none of us are immune to it and we definitely calculate the finances in byte sizes rather than the whole and i love how you said that the iphone is the indian dream—i have had that thought for a while now so yes and that dream is not ending anytime soon in fact i do believe that apple will be jn their golden era in terms of sale this time around sure prices might be a little dicey but its possible that if the 17 gets quite high in price the 16 will sell like hotcakes as the previous series always does and many ppl bank on that the difference still remains though—that the latest is up for grabs for the richest—and the similar part is that its still a luxury lifestyle piece to show off the ecosystem  other benefits is very much 2ndary/comes in w hands-on experience would love to see more vids like this from techwiser

Text: after a point you just wanted a phone that just worked and didn’t make you work android user for life but now apple all the way 
did recently buy a samsung device and let’s just say the difference is glaring esim transfer doesn’t work even between samsung devices data transfer took like 3 hrs and an additional 8 in the background the 3hrs had to be monitored constantly to not lose any data during the transfer
whereas when shifting from my 13 to 16 it only took 20 mins and everything was just as i left it

Text: for any company to succeed they either have to be cost leaders or differentiators apple is the latter a company cant have trillion dollar market cap just by doing nothing jo dikhta h wo bikta hai sure apple may not be the same company fundamentally it was 10 years ago but nonetheless they still keep making high quality products which makes you feel like its worth the grand youve spent on it call it marketing gimmick or false perception or me as a glazer apple products are loved by millions around the world for what they provide there are other european and asian markets where people earn a lot more than us and even then they continue to use apple products so its not just about show off there are numerous other competing brands who offer exorbitant features at the same price point but still cant be equally as good as the way apple makes their products i can have an option to choose between a product that offers 20 different features of which i will use only 10 or i can have a product that offers me 7 different features of which i will use 5 its very simple theres nobody forcing you to use apple products but for those who do you cant simply call them stupid because ultimately the money they are paying are also hard earned just like you who paid over a lakh to buy an android

Text: apple is unique in the sense that they design their own hardware software and services in-house
no other company does that

and just because the initial price of entry into their products is high doesn't mean they are overpriced
they are absolutely perfect for what they offer in their respective price range

the android guys are good till mid tier price range but when it comes to flagship prices those guys are absolute scamsters in that they want to charge higher than apple without even putting in half the effort to perfect their devices

these android oems would rather produce half assed overpriced garbage than undercutting apple by the right price point

all the t_rds in the comments simply can't accept apple makes better products when it comes to this price range 
apple has the best display when it comes to color accuracy and highest typicalauto brightness and hdr brightness over 70 area

better speakers and haptics and build quality
better soc by far
better pics except some gimmicky scenarios
far better videos and stability with support for prores
more stable and better ui/ux  and polished os

but alas indian turds love hating on apple blindly without understanding their business model
these android guys are the scamsters for trying to charge the same prices as apple without even putting in half the effort

and indians are upset more people are able to afford iphones  what a bunch of petty and jealous t_rds they are

but lots of people out of that 10  are also buying iphonesthat's interesting

also most people's (in india) their first consumer computer is a phone not a pc unlike the 1st world/imperial core nation's consumers
 so they like to spend more on a phone( also these same population don't have access to climate controlled roomsauto washing and  drying machinecars health insurance or supported by govt like in the nordic nations) unlike in the he first world nations if a person there can buy an iphone they afford almost of these above-mentioned 21st century lifestyle amenities

so by buying an  iphone can help them(working class third worlders/imperial peripheral consumers) cope with the extreme inequality in india

Text: bro do you remember me you suggested me s24 or iphone 15 because i was confused between realme gt 7 or oneplus 13r
after doing a lot of research i made a decision to buy realme gt 7 pro
i know you want to tell me that iqoo 13 is better but bro my parents don't know that brand and i can't buy an online phone
i hope you can understand me
please say how's my decision and i want a detailed review if you can please

Text: i personally enjoy the open gate system of android and the options of phones you can get based on your preference like camera or display or processor etc 
but as i'm hearing that even android is going to stop custom rom developments and  side loading of appsetc i find it a very hard pill to swallow i have used iphones but came back to android again and again because i'm a power user 
and money is not the constraint that's keeping me in the android ecosystem i'll happily buy an iphone 16 pro or max or whatever is the latest the day google closes the gates and makes it a gated community i'll switch immediately (plus i like the google way of doing things like minimalist asthetic way)

ad on other part functionality of ios is very low in front of android there is no universal back option what i was shocked when i saw it if application is not giving you option to go back then only thing you can do is go back at home there are many problems in its ui

on top of that snapdragon crossed apple in performance in 8 gen 2 [and for those incels those who say come after 2 years or 5 years you can come my iqoo 12 is 1 year old come with your latest iphone 16 pro max ultra whatever my processor will win ok and sbi is using pentium cpu today also macbook didn't even existed at that time so ]

android mein 60hz deke 1 lakh mein bechke dikhado maan jaunga kyuki jaise hi kisi ka budget 1 lakh tak jata h uske dimag mein bas 3 hi brand aata h samsung iphone and pixel
brand value always dominates over features and updates
for example- louis vuitton ki bag mein kya khas rehta h kuch bhi nhi tab bhi log satisfaction and premium feel ke liye brand value pay krte hjab tak apple products most premium and satisfying feel deta rahega tab tak wo chalta rahega  features ka kya h new new phone kharidke 2-4 din show off krte h mere phone ye features h wo features h but fir phone bas call message and media consumption ke hi kaam aata h

Text: apple has been using reflections and transparency for years before xiaomi probably existed the “aqua” design language from years ago already had glass reflection as did the reflective dock macos already had semi transparent frosted glass years ago as did ios 7 

apple is just carrying on with that design but making it transparent 

the only one copying is android

Text: please please help us kyuki kyc ki btt h aur company koi response nhi kr rha h 


there’s a scam-like issue going on with jio’s online sim porting system

i personally ported my number to jio through their official website got the otp and delivery date and the status showed “out for delivery” but the delivery guy never called never came and no sim was delivered

after that there’s no update no sim no refund nothing

i called customer care multiple times — they just copy-paste replies like “wait for 24 hours” or “complaint has been forwarded” but nothing actually happens raised a complaint through the myjio app same story went to the local jio store and they said “this is an online order we can’t help”

later i searched online and found hundreds or maybe thousands of people facing the same problem it’s not just me

feels like jio’s entire online delivery system is fake or broken

requesting any youtuber or tech reviewer reading this — please talk about this issue people are suffering and nobody’s listening

plz plz raise voice against this

Text: you have some serious issues with apple samsung can carry the same design software experience and worse battery experience every year atleast this is common for s22 ultra followed by s23 ultra 24 ultra and even 25ultra you don’t see a problem there but if apple is doing that its a problem to you at least  apple is courageous to do it first

Text: after watching wwdc 2025 it genuinely feels like the innovation engine at apple has slowed down most of the updates were minor ui tweaks many seemingly inspired by features android has had for years yet apple continues to brand these small changes as “groundbreaking” os advancements there was hardly anything that truly pushed boundaries or sparked excitement—just more polish on the same old interface it’s starting to feel like they’re out of fresh ideas and are relying more on hype than on real innovation

Text: im still doing blinkit

per order if the distance between dark store and destination is below 1km i get a fixed base pay of 15 rs else it averages to 10rs per km remember this pay is only for ride from dark store to customer we dont get any pay for return journey so basically i get 5rs per km of actual travel

my scooter is petrol-fuelled i drive at the economy speed of 40kmph and do not use throttle aggressively to extract the mileage of 50kmpl that is 2rs per km

as im doing it for part time im only eligible for incentive of ₹4 per order (that is extra 4rs per order fulfillment above the base pay) this incentive reaches ₹8/₹10 on saturday and sunday respectively 


per hour im may get 1-3 orders (₹60 - ₹80 per hour) on low demand time and 2-4 orders (₹80 - ₹100 per hour) on higher demand time

normally monday saturday and sunday have higher demand so i do 6-8 hours on such days thus i get from ₹600-₹850 on such days
on other days demand is lower so i do 4 - 6 hours and get ₹300 to ₹450 on such days

in summary i earn around ₹2800-₹3400 per week (work of 7 days) from which around 30 amount goes to fuel charge thus my actual earning is like ₹1900 - ₹2400

problems i face
1 the store managers demand us to work even though the way i understand the terms and conditions we are allowed to work any time and for any duration and blinkit does not have the right to demand my login they call me everyday and ask why i didn't login at certain time they are quite forgiving for the part-timers but strict towards full-timers
2 some buildings do not have elevators so i have to climb 3-4 floors with heavy bag sometimes
3 although this one is the part of our work it is quite time-consuming i loose much time inside big apartments where the security first takes our details some times we have to wait for gate approval and then walk like 50-100 mtrs to the building and wait for the elevators
4 the map shows wrong route thus making us taking another route after reaching the initially marked destination for which we are not fairly componsated in my opinion i loose much time in such situations
5 our scooters gets damaged very quickly if i do 6 hours duty per day my total travel distance would be around 70 kms and considering the road conditions in any city all the nuts get loosen very quickly the plastic body parys gets damaged etc

Text: instead of government allowing companies to use these shady tactics they should force  them add delivery fee  say 50 rupees or more that goes directly to the delivery partner this way customers understand the actual cost of the service they’re availing nothing is truly free or cheap—someone always pays the price

right now quick  commerce companies artificially lowering product prices misleading consumers while systematically undercutting local kirana stores  but this isn’t just about killing kiranas—they’re targeting the entire legacy distribution system once that collapses they’ll be in a position to establish a monopoly with no real competition left standing

Text: hey prateek

i’m a student too and also work as a delivery partner i’ve been doing this for the past two years and have worked with almost all the 10-minute food and grocery delivery apps

you’ve covered a lot of important points and honestly the best part is that someone is finally speaking up about these issues i’ve been hoping to have a conversation like this but there are still a few key things that often get missed

1 incentive-based earnings aren’t as simple as they seem
there’s also a minimum login time requirement for example in swiggy you have to log in for 9 hours out of 12 to qualify for full-time incentives for part-time it’s 4 hours and 30 minutes out of 5 even if you're short by a second you lose the incentive

in zepto there are two types of slots — peak and normal you need to complete at least one gig and one normal slot daily just to qualify but that’s not all — weekly incentives are even more demanding

8 weekday peak slots

1 weekday non-peak slot

4 weekend peak slots

4 weekend non-peak slots

and a 9-hour login on sunday (recently changed to fri sat and sun)



2 there are different types of delivery partner ids
some are based on earnings targets others on orders time or even whatsapp incentives this creates a lot of pressure because two partners doing the same number of deliveries might earn very differently for example completing 322 orders per week in zepto may get you

₹10–11k on a normal id

₹15–19k on a whatsapp incentive id



3 you’re forced to purchase delivery assets when you join — a shirt and a bag costing ₹500–1000 without them you can’t deliver they ask for selfies after each order or while delivering — fair for the shirt maybe but the bag becomes a hassle


4 strict lateness policies
in zepto if you're more than 10 minutes late compared to the eta from google maps you get logged out blinkit gives 30 minutes but it’s still tough in swiggy you must accept all orders if volume is high — reject more than one and you lose your incentive
there's no such thing as "ming" — those extra earnings are only offered to those who’ve been inactive for over a week


5 unfair deductions
tds missing bag charges asset costs insurance — they deduct from your earnings without asking for consent if you don’t log in for a week managers or rsis (regional support in-charges) will call you repeatedly sometimes asking for live location refuse and your id might get banned or penalized


6 slot fines and manipulation
miss a slot you’re fined stay inactive for a few days suddenly you’re given attractive incentives — but with a catch orders will be assigned from the farthest stores making it harder to complete more in less time


7 pickers and packers face brutal conditions too
they’re judged on something called an ipp score — basically how fast they pick items they have to run around tight aisles and pick items within 15 seconds many get swollen feet in the beginning there’s constant pressure from rsis or sis yelling at them by name all this for ₹12k a month — and the pay only increases if they meet steep targets 9-hour shifts nonstop


8 extreme delivery loads without support
one of my colleagues had to deliver 118 items in a single order — enough to fill a small pickup truck but he was expected to handle it alone no extra pay no buddy partner (like blinkit provides) and customers face no limits on how much they can order




---

that’s just a glimpse of what we go through

if you ever plan to make a video or need more information i’m in i personally work smart — i only pick shifts with extra incentives or ming guarantee just enough to make ₹4–5k/month so i work 2–3 days a week across stores during offer periods

but full-time delivery partners they face far more hardship please keep raising your voice — they need it


i corrected the grammar with ai so don't think its fake just wanna make it more clear

Text: i have worked in one of the dark stores of blinkit as a picker- a person who collects all the items of the order puts in the paper bag scans it and gives it to the rider 

wanted to provide some insights over that aspect

• you get the order on your device that you're given and it has a timer (roughly 15 to 20 seconds for picking each item and 1 to 2½ min per order)
and mind you these dark stores have way too many shelves and zones (normal items section heavy item section like rice atta  vegetables section milk and cold beverages section and frost section) and moving around these sections takes a lot of time
• if you aren't able to pick on time you'll be shouted on by managers and  riders there's no dignity
• you've to keep running all the time no matter what you'll be restless throughout your shift
• just like the riders there are milestones for picking (₹25 on picking 200 items in 2 hrs) and so on which is nearly impossible
• and lastly you get 50 paisa per item picked which roughly is ₹120 for two hours including the milestone bonus
• and if you make a mistake(eg you gave 3 packet of milk instead of 4) you're penalised ₹20 per instance even though you earned just ₹6 from that order

Text: hi i live in bangalore work in a tech firm and use quick commerce almost every day the twist is on weekends saturdays and sundays i sometimes take out my bikes and work as a delivery partner for platforms like blinkit swiggy zomato instamart zepto and occasionally even rapido and ola  i own two bikes a ns400z and an x440 so you can say that i am not doing this for money as all the money goes for petrol and let me tell you these platforms actually pay decently on average i work about 6 hours and earn somewhere between 700 to 1000 sometimes even more depending on perks and surge timings now coming to the criticisms quick-commerce platforms face i’m here to defend them
1 “they don’t do background verification”
these are gig-based jobs not full-time corporate employment with pf esi or pension riders are independent contractors and hence a valid driver’s license and minimum age are the only core requirements to onboard yes anyone can register easily that’s the point the low entry barrier gives lakhs of unemployed or under-skilled people a source of income platforms do implement checks random selfies gps verification otp delivery etc still some misuse happens but let’s be honest if an underage rider is on the road it’s the traffic police or transport authorities’ job to penalize them not blinkit’s
2 “they don’t provide insurance”
100 false i personally met with an accident while delivering i called the customer support they sent roadside assistance and covered my medical expenses but yes tcs apply like any insurance if you’re not wearing a helmet or basic safety gear you won’t get coverage this is not a platform-specific rule it's in every motor insurance policy across india
3 “they don’t pay anything if a rider dies”
again not true there are cases where families of deceased riders received compensation but again compensation applies only when safety guidelines are followed especially wearing helmets it's bad but it’s exactly how every insurance policy works
4 “they push riders to work more”
this one i partially agree with
yes there’s subtle pressure through incentive structures surge bonuses and target-based rewards but at least these platforms offer compensation for extra work can you say the same for most tech companies like the one i work for 
where managers say “increment ke time dekh lenge abhi kaam karo” and burn you out without a penny more
yes quick commerce thrives on cheap labour that’s the ugly truth but who should we blame the platforms or a system that allows no enforceable minimum wage no robust labour protection laws for gig workers and no long-term safety nets quick commerce has given income to millions in urban and rural india if they’re exploiting cheap labour it’s only because our policy ecosystem and government is useless

Text: so i worked both full-time and part-time as a picker at blinkit and here’s the truth from my end

i started working as a part-time picker where i could book 2-hour slots like 8–10 am and so on my first day was just training from the second day onward i started earning but if you're new as a part-time picker they assign you almost impossible orders—like 60 items in 2 minutes or items that are extremely rare and hard to find in the store

the store i worked at was run by a group of friends who were all full-timers and they did whatever they wanted i saw things that were totally unhygienic and clearly violated blinkit’s terms of service for example milk packets were submerged in about an inch of a slimy germ-filled layer when i complained about this i was told i couldn’t work there anymore and my shift slot got deleted

items were never sorted properly if i asked something from the sorting team they would just say “find it yourself or get out” it felt like once a friend group got in they completely controlled the warehouse and made it impossible for others to work peacefully

full-time work was somehow even worse you first have to book appointments and i got rejected five times for no reason when i finally got in it was the same issue one group controlled everything the worst part—only 3 holidays per month if you take even one more you're fired penalties are applied for no reason again because the group running the store abuses their power if you try to complain—you’re fired if you try to do the right thing—you’re fired

so yeah blinkit is a nightmare—not just for ordering dairy products but also for handling their employees

Text: i think this 10-minute delivery system is kind of a doom for us as a society on one hand i agree it's more convenient for some people but on the other hand we don’t realize how many local shops are getting shut down or earning way less which eventually leads to them closing so one blinkit or zepto store might be taking down 4–5 general stores in an area stores run by families who rely on that income
even for us users i think it's not great we're interacting less with people and becoming more reserved i’ve noticed this in myself too being an introvert i used to prefer using these apps but once i realized this i started trying to go to local shops more
also just think what if these big companies one day capture the market so much that they start manipulating the prices of everyday things we’ll have no choice but to pay whatever they ask because there’ll be no local shops left no bargaining nothing i know this won’t happen now or even in the next 10 years but honestly i think it will happen someday

Text: one very important aspect that often gets overlooked is the behavior of these riders on the roads if you observe carefully they are frequently found violating traffic rules i don't entirely blame them—most of them are uneducated and trapped in an aggressive incentive-based system created by these companies in their race to earn incentives they are willing to do whatever it takes

the truth is no one really needs groceries in 10 minutes if someone does there should be a reasonable delivery fee fairly split between the rider and the company unfortunately these companies are prioritizing rapid growth and revenue over safety and sustainability

Text: i myself was a delivery boy and totally understand the problems but by doing proper research and not employing that under age person is not a solution maybe that person has come to do the job at such a lower age because his family is dependent upon him that will make more people unemployed and more families hungry 
if we all really want to change the situation we must follow the following points
• always treated them with respect and love
• make sure you receive the order exactly as the mentioned address and don't make their life harder
• if possible give cash tips 
• appreciate their work whenever possible
the government should make rules so that 
• the delivery persons get life and medical insurance from the company
• minimum 1 day per week holiday

Text: the question  from this episode what did you learn

answer  partly lies in the video itself "the top 3 cr population of india " who are doing white collar jobs mostly are served by these delivery guys (these delivery guys in their point of view something earning is better than no earning) bcoz these guys wouldnt fit all most all jobs except construction  road cleaning kind of jobsso for them swiggy delivery is way more good job than a road cleaner


all these analysis being done by various youtube channels  news channels are useless unless we show a respecting job to delivery guys unfortunately they  are not even barely qualified for these kind of jobs

they continue to deliver  and 3 cr top people continue to order

Text: great video after a very long time congratulations

the lack of labour laws is all around and not only in quick commerce exploitation however is by choice in this case

the riders want to make more money and hence want to do more deliveries incentives are paid as per the rider choice they are not penalised for late delivery which seems fair 

the minimum wages should be fixed for such kind of jobs so that the rider can choose if he wants more money with the payments at the current rate making fewer deliveries is almost pointless so all of them rush around to do more

Text: undoubtedly the most stupid video of the channel i subscribed to see technology i don't want to see you moral police the tech giants
1 almost all the corporate jobs in india are target and incentive based
2 in the population india is having and number of people not having basic job if a 17 year old kid is able to make some money by finding a loop hole is doing no harm to anyone l
3 its the responsibility of the police to not allow anyone underage ride a bike  which is still a task in this country
4 agree that companies need to privide basic health insurance cover of 1 lakh to the riders but these are partners and not employees make the law little less applicable in this case but it is required
5 quick commerce need to start affiliate links to tech youtubers so that this type of videos and coparisons to amazon could stop

quick commerce industry is a boon to this population all of househelps husbands are doing this without even owning a bike and they are very happy with it

Text: the solution to every problem isn’t simply to throw our hands up and say “things are terrible” videos like this should do more than provoke outrage — they should spark action hopefully they push us to strengthen employment regulations and ensure that basic protections for both consumers and workers aren’t neglected

the burden doesn’t lie solely with the customer — nor just with the producer it’s on the entire b2b ecosystem proper insurance systems access to healthcare and mental health support worker education robust infrastructure — all of it when each part of the chain holds itself to a higher standard the whole system begins to function with dignity and accountability

Text: one more thing to add is that there is no personal growth in this delivery profession  coz a company is going to give same amount of delivery charge to a joinee and also to a person working since 2 years
also everyone has 24 hours in a day there is a cap to maximum no of orders a person can deliver 
so there is always an upper limit of earning which i guess is not above 25k

Text: yesterday i had an incident firstly he took too much time to pick up the order from the store and then he was stuck in the traffic at a signal and later his bike broke down itseems 
he was absolutely worried and called me that he would be late by 10 min i am fine with it absolutely np
my thought after this was that for him to be soo worried about being on time he must have gone through rude customers before who might have complained/scolded about him being late do people really complain about such things how cheap of them 
there are very very few cases when things are needed in 10min if you really dont have that need then please dont complain/scold them if they come late understand that it is not so easy to drive that quick in cities

Text: oh man  this video is pushing a totally one-sided narrative first of all 18 is not an illegal age to work — it’s the legal age for most forms of employment under indian labour law ‍ yes driving without a license under 18 is illegal  but if someone is using a fake id to sign up that’s fraud by the individual ‍ not a failure by blinkit blinkit does kyc  but if a franchise fails to verify properly that’s on them — not the entire platform second part-time jobs for teenagers should be legally supported in india like other countries  — it builds financial awareness  and work ethic early third accidents happen in every sector  if you're blaming blinkit for an accident then by that logic we should shut down the entire transport industry  — which makes zero sense fourth if a delivery partner violates terms by using an unauthorized vehicle  blinkit isn’t liable for damages — it’s already clearly stated in their terms  fifth using loaded words like “kali dukan” is just psychological manipulation  — it makes a legal business look shady without evidence i personally got my exam hall ticket  delivered at 6 am via blinkit ⏰ when no cafe was open — that’s real-world value and convenience  i paid the same price i’d pay on amazon but got it in minutes instead of days don’t let a viral video  twist your thinking — use logic  not just emotion and see both sides

Text: great topic bhaiya- it is actually important that the labor is not taken advantage of 

but the video felt rushed a bit- there were some news snippet headlines which we can't even read and you mentioned that you undertook delivering and visited a dark store but then didn't mention it or talk about it much 

this could've been a 20-25 minute video and we would've loved that

Text: these quick commerce companies are burning vc money when the money runs they'll start charging more and that's when their growth will plateau most will order only last minute things mostly groceries as long as they are delivering fast and are price competitive with traditional e-commerce they can continue to grow 
just look at the zomato and swiggy's food business they've stopped growing as restaurants have jacked prices and these delivery apps charge even more over those inflated prices

Text: i wlasys pay with cash no tipping through any app be it blinkit zepto or zmato/swiggy i pay a bit extra not much but suppose i order stuff worth 487 so i'll pay 500 and return the change during the hot summer months i always have some bottles stored above my shoe-rack so that i can offer them water quickly without the need to go inside again

i think this overall this is a good system for indian conditions however some reforms need to be made mandatory accidental insurance cover of at least 5l for each driver life insurance of at least 5l and a revised incentive structure that focuses more on quality and less on speed as for the customers better premium membership structure and equal pricing for all 

i understand that a lot of young people (i have seen two girls working for zepto and one is from my neighbourhood) are getting a source of income from these delivery services but their safety should be prioritized more and some kind of basic minimum pay should be made mandatory in case someone falls ill for a couple of days and their incentive progress is screwed not much even as little as 5k a month would be okay

Text: people who work using petrol every day are the highest taxpayers in this country  the actual price of petrol is ₹3599 but we are paying ₹9449 per litre  that means we are paying 61 extra  petrol is used in almost all transport  so even tax-free products still need fuel to reach us —so we end up paying tax indirectly on everything  if we are paying 61 extra just to move ‍ this is no less than the british invasion  just in a new form  the hard-working people of this country are being looted in the name of “development”  may god give wisdom to the leg-worshippers  and the people who are being looted by the system ‍

COMMENT #3011
------------------------------
Text: difference between apple and all other chip makers is that their chips dont use core designs by arm ill explain
arm provides liceses for the architecture itself (opcodes isas hdl ip etc) and another license which also includes core designs (cortex series)

while all other companies use core designs from arm apple chose to design their own cores from ground up this has actually allowed them to 
a) pay less for licenses
b) achieve great efficiency at structural level and introduce features like high bandwidth interconnects which literally allows them to fuse 2 processors with each other and they function as 1 single unit

but this comes at a great price of rnd which is where xiaomi actually wins for now as they did not have to design their own cores all they had to do was negotiating a better deal with arm for core designs which they'll happily provide given that competition is rising in this space and risc is gaining popularity (see what jim keller is doing with his new startup research lab - he worked apple and built processors for iphones)

now just for the processor they win but apple saves a lot with whole package their cores are more efficient so they can save on battery and cooling they can opt for standard pcie storage they can reuse components from their a series cores in their m series of processors and more if i knew more about this id be working at apple but i beat they are saving more than xiaomi on the whole package and they have a solid foundation which they can use to switch to risc architecture as well only time will tell

anyways what xiaomi pulled of is impressive but given the exorbitant prices snapdragon is expecting for their processors expect more companies to jump the ship and foray into "custom processor" domain

i just dumped my thoughts here i really like your sensible coverage of tech keep it up man )

Text: if you're wondering about the difference between lpddr5x and lpddr5t ram on mobile devices these two memory types are the latest evolutions in low-power dram used in smartphones and other portable electronics 

lpddr5x vs lpddr5t what’s the difference

1 performance (speed)

lpddr5x

maximum data rate up to 8533 mbps

already a big leap from standard lpddr5 (6400 mbps)

lpddr5t ("t" stands for "turbo")

maximum data rate up to 9600 mbps

this makes it the fastest lpddr memory available as of now

2 power efficiency

both lpddr5x and lpddr5t are based on low-power design principles but

lpddr5t uses voltage and timing optimizations to stay efficient even at higher speeds

designed to maintain energy efficiency while pushing performance further

 so even though it’s faster lpddr5t doesn’t necessarily use more power thanks to smart tuning
lpddr5t is about 125 faster than lpddr5x translating to quicker data access and better performance in high-end applications like gaming ai tasks and video processing

Text: for all the folks who are thing that any big phone manufacturing company will make there fully self developed chip then you are so wrong my friend
tsmc is making these chips from 1987 making chips need very complex process from the design to the manufacturing if even apple try to make a fully self developed chip it will take them minimum 5 to 10 years and the income they generated in 5 to 10 years 
and one more thing you will probably wait for the next i phone like we are waiting for gta 6 
so i hope you got your answer you didn't really wanted

Text: the thing is it is the usual "not telling the entire story" thing xiaomi is only interested in the stock market there is no company smartphone related on this planet that has more financial interest in being apple or samsung or above these two giants than xiaomi they are not interested in making good smartphones they happen to be profiting from the downfall of huawei and the recession thats the only reason they are succesful huawei is getting worse i couldnt believe that it would ever happen but it is starting right now but huaweis potential was immense because they are so close to the chinese government what xiaomi did was very simple charge the same price as apple and samsung and everything will work out people cant distinguish between the "eco system" trap that the industry is heading into they dont understand that everything will peak in the "blue bubble green bubble" situation that apple is currently in my enthusiasm for smartphones will never break but xiaomi is the reason why i despise this industry ask yourself why is this chip not really faster than everything else why is a ten core chip still slower than apple i give you a hint because it is still a single core chip industry why do you think googles tensor chips are 4 generations behind or samsung exynos because of financial interest these companies are comparable to apple and they are not able to compete or be much much better than apple it is 18 years since the first iphone this is not competition competition would mean that oppo would be the new huawei they developed the mari silicon range of chips they had to dump the idea of a 12 mbit/sec audio chip because it was too good thats the only explanation i have the only explanation i have is that all competitors of samsung or apple are consulted by people who want a competitionless market who do these people work for i dont mean from whom they get their money i mean who wants them to be placed there i know what a 1000 dollar smartphone is and i know what a 100 dollar smartphone is we have a market where 1000 dollar smartphones operate the same way as a samsung galaxy s5 from 10 years ago what i mean is if you are a professional youre still using 2000 dollar dslr cameras for your vlogs or 50000 dollar red cameras for your movies and if youre a professional in the movie industry you dont even talk about smartphones professionals would not use smartphones for anything else than social media reels shorts random posts or texting where is the real "work horse" smartphone for everything 18 years after the breakthrough these companies only care about the stock market is it really important how thin a smartphone is for samsung the answer is yes oppo did the same mistake 10 years ago in 2014 with the oppo r5 what samsung will try to do is to convince you that the 25 edge never happened when it fails i dont even have to watch videos on this topic to know the answer because samsung doesnt care since true wireless headphones are a real thing for more than 5 years now nobody touches their smartphone that often the smartphones of today could be the size of a dslr camera with the same qualities and for not more than lets say 700 dollars but why is samsung not doing it not trying but doing because financial interests are more important sony doesnt want you to have an alternative to sonys very expensive dslr cameras because tiny smartphone sensors are easier to sell midrange smartphones are horrible good to sell bad to own there are so many aspects to talk about but financial interests do not allow this this is one of the many smartphones "only released in china" but why same with oppos origin os or huaweis harmony os still only available in china and visually very attractive useful and interesting same with this xiaomis 15s pro that has this "interesting" (motorola did this heavily 10 years ago in the droid line of phones) kevlar back the kevlar material was used in the poco f1 one of the only phones in the last 7 years that i am really thinking about this material if it would be used intelligent could have replaced glass motorola experimented with the shatter shield glass that was plastic but was prone to scratches so kevlar back shatter shield front and all problems could have been solved with a little bit more investment in research but no financial interests selling midrange to low end smartphones to the lowest end barely usable and convincing people that they can do "everything" with their smartphone and all people do is using whatsapp wechat paypal amazon ebay youtube and getting no real traction or real income because the very few that really gain income do it with a professional background and it only works for very few will xiaomis xring finally outbeat apple for the last 3 years android has outbeat apple according to social media and apple lost only 50 million phones sold quarterly globally the magical 200 million phones sold globally in a year by samsung apple and now xiaomi why this pattern because of the average consumer no because of consulting financial interest lets wait for the moment when the snapdragon 8 elite architecture gets to the midrange will it outbeat apple finally no because developers (apps games smartphones eco systems)  believe in capitalism and paid work and apple provides that where are the open world games for android there are five relevant games on android and all of them are anime based only one game odin valhalla rising is not anime based and could be interesting out of china i love all open world games available on android but theres a lack of choice tencent wanted to revolutionize the mobile gaming market where is the revolution nowhere to find because sony microsoft and nintendo are not interested i havent even touched ai which is a step backwards because research money is being pumped into marketing and execution samsung bixby could have been the first intelligent ai on smartphones and siri echo google assistant celiabut all of them were just try and error why because a smartphone is built to be touched and used only being talked to doesnt work if it worked we all could have a cheap 10 dollar fitness tracker on our wrist with a chip and a stable internet connection and true wireless earbuds and everything text call or knowledge based would be done through that some people on the streets are doing this people in cars are doing this but theres still the new apple galaxy s and xiaomi smartphone fortexting buying and random social media posts do people really believe in the gary vee hustle making millions with selling products through smartphones again this works only for a minority good smartphones exist if the developers dont care about image if they care about image everything is a slate phone image is financial interest and interesting smartphones dont care about design design is image for the development of useful technology design was never interesting or useful only for financial interests

and chipsets are gonna be made by tsmc or samsung

if xiaomi is making thier own chips theyre still running on android

the only self reliant one - because they have no other option due to bans - is huawei
and they have already overtaken apple in china - where google services are useless
so in a way huawei has made a walled garden better than apple - which is reinforced by multiple governments' bad decisions

i know about this phone wanted to see how youtubers handle it so wasted 5+ mins

don't take me wrong mdk 8350 is not a bad processors for 23k but competition poco f6 and many other offer more than or equal performance

Text: i’ve been using the infinix gt 20 pro for a year now as my secondary phone and here’s my honest experience
 my usage
	•	heavy mobile gaming (with discord running in the background)
	•	handles every task effortlessly – truly a beast
 software
	•	started with xos 14 (android 14) now updated to xos 15 (android 15)
	•	packed with useful features (some are gimmicky but most are genuinely helpful)
	•	no ads in the ui – super clean and feature-rich experience
 hardware  performance
	•	delivers pure raw performance
	•	no heating issues (only gets slightly warm after 3+ hours of continuous gaming or during hyper-charge)
	•	jbl speakers and 144hz amoled screen make media consumption a delight
 battery life
	•	easily get 8+ hours of sot (screen-on time) with 1-15 hours of gaming
 camera (cons)
	•	108mp main camera captures detailed photos
	•	hdr/light control could be better especially in challenging lighting
have any questions drop them below – happy to help i'm not a promoter

Text: but still i'd say edge 50 neo is the best in it 's class it's a fully loaded phone in it's range bar none i wouldn't complain about the battery because power users won' t buy this phone due to it's dimensity 7300 processor

 also the potential drawback of the low battery capacity issue is well  compensated in the device by using a small display which is an ltpo display that can switch from 1 hz to 120hz an energy efficient cpu along with a 68w pd charger which can charge the phone pretty quickly so the battery department is well taken care of for a normal user
 the features
15k hdr 10+ display
dolby atmos with dual stereo speakers and hi res audio for both wired and wireless devices
50mp main camera with ois
13mp uw + macro camera
10 mp 3x telephoto camera with ois all cameras with 4k 30fps recording
nfc
wireless/reverse wireless charging 
68w pd charger included
compact form factor

 i think there are no other phones to compete in the all rounder segment with such features as far as a normal user is concerned

Text: what is your opinion on that

one ui don't have some useful features

1 connection speed meter

2 apps can't be restricted properly to using mobile data or wifi but working normally offline

3 app lock feature

reasons

1 connection speed meter is required whether my connection is stable or not and monitor my apps if they are consuming data in background

2 on my previous xiaomi phone i used to run offline apps which were unnecessarily loads ads when i connect data if it is data restricted then the app goes offline despite of being online and no any data consume then no any irritating ads

3 1st of all secure folder is
different thing it like 2nd space or android in your phone no link with the 1st one what if i want to lock some of my 1st space apps which i can't so i need to sent the app to secure folder and then the account will be changed

bonous

doesn't have proper dual apps support example- i want to use 2 separate gpay app for 2 separate bank (note - secure folder can't use payment apps cause it doesn't have any separate massage app)

Text: apple changing the numbers does make some sense as a branding strategy let me explain first of all the numbers are getting absurd anything above 20 would sound weird and meaningless just like android first stopped the dessert naming and then switched to numbers second all the versions are different numbers leading to confusion an year name is much easier to remember and make sense of and lastly naming it 26 a bit more sense than 25 as all the os will release for public in september and will be used mostly in 26 from jan-september until the next update so as most of the usage of the softwares will be 2026 it is ok to name it 26 i have been wanting apple to stop with the numbers in iphones too and simply call them iphone 2026 2027 and so on but with a hardware product the release date is more important so naming it a year further than the current year makes a bit less sense but it is fine

Text: update after warranty nah man i’m good i’m literally so afraid of green/pink line i stopped updating my s22 since it’s warranty period crossed even chinese companies are giving out of warranty screen replacements but big brands like samsung apple are literally blind (those time specific replacements from samsung doesn’t make sense)

and just checked x earlier so many people complaining about bugs in s23 series after one ui 7 update

let’s go back to 1 year of software update

Text: in us they follow a logic example for new model car for that particular year the will call by next year (2026 model instead 2025 model) if you see the latest rav4 they call it rav 4 2026 model not 2025 model and this not just the case of toyota but all manufacturers it may be confusing to us but for them its more convenient  also to consider this so called ios 26 is gonna used more time in 2026 than 2025 which is just 3 months in 2025 and 9 months in 2026

Text: ngl but i just recieved the one ui 7 update like 15 days ago it was a game changer because one ui 5 and 6 were very laggy on s23 i hope they make the lag go away with one ui8 because there is lag when i use trading apps for 20 30 mins and there is still alot of jitter and non animated elements in the ui but i really appreciate the more fluid feel and responsive animations of one ui 7 and one ui 8 looks like my customised one ui 7 i like bigger icons and clean less cluttered look one ui 7 started that trend but it's great to see that samsung is making more things bigger and rounded let's see how good the one ui 8 is but honestly speaking the os has more than enough features and just needs that amazing optimization this was my analysis of samsungs ui let me know your thoughts

COMMENT #4953

Text: the s25 edge is basically a "me first" flex for samsung this is basically designed  marketed yo build a buzz around samsung  its working bcoz most hands-on  reviews have a bunch of views am personally gonna check it out physically in the showroom just to get a feel but i wouldnt buy it
also the negatives around the 3900mah are over-rated bcoz battery challenge tests show that s25 edge(3900mah) can compete or outlast googlepixel 9 pro xl(5060mah) so oneui 7 has definitely been well optimised on this 
but overall the pricing of this vs s25 plus doesn't make sense s25 plus is just more valueformoney
 i think future ultra slim phones only make sense for the upper mid-range segment bcoz anybody paying 1000 or more wants specs geared towards a gaming phone or a poweruser phone of which the s25 edge is not
huawei nova 12s_69mm_4500mah
vivo v40e/iqoo z9s_75mm_5000mah
infinix hot 50 pro plus_68_5000mah
above phones are slim  lite weight  practical
